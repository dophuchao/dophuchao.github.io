Computers are dumb. They only do what they’re told. How do you tell a computer what to do? You use a programming language. The very first thing you’ll do when learning a new programming language is how to make the computer display “Hello, World”.

There is no perfect programming language, they all offer something a little different, and there are hundreds of programming languages with new ones being created every day.


> Here is a selection of programming languages that have a place in the programming hall of fame. They’re all either used today or have contributed something to the art of computer languages.

## C++ 
```c++
#include "iostream"
using namespace std;

int main() {
    printf("Hello world");
    return 0;
}
```

## Python 

```python
print("Hello world!")
```

## Java
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
